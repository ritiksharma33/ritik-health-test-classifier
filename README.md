# ritik-health-test-classifier
Streamlit app that predicts medical test results (Normal, Abnormal, or Inconclusive) based on patient info using a logistic regression model.
# ðŸ©º Medical Test Result Classifier

This is a simple yet powerful **Streamlit web app** that predicts whether a patient's medical test result is **Normal**, **Abnormal**, or **Inconclusive** using a **Logistic Regression model** trained on synthetic medical data.

You enter:
- Age  
- Gender  
- Blood Type  
- Medical Condition  
- Admission Type  
- Medication  
- Day of the week

ðŸ‘‰ Based on this data, the app predicts the likely medical test outcome using a trained logistic regression model (`.pkl` file).
